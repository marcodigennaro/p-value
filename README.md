null hypothesis H0: population from city is tall 168
alternative hypothesis H1: population is tall not 168

# ## Z vs T values

# HOW MNAY STDEV FROM THE MEAN MY RESULT IS?

z_score = (xbar - mu) / sigma
normal distribution, population standard deviation sigma is known, and n>30.

t_score (aka Student's T-Distribution) = (xbar - mu) / (s/sqrt(n))
normal distribution, population standard deviation (sigma) is NOT known,
but the sample standard deviation (s) is known, and n<30.

Summary: If n > 30, z ~ t.
If the population standard deviation s is available and n > 30,
t_score can be used with sigma instead of the s.
